## Usage

## CSV Format

The CSV file includes the following columns:

- **Type**: Request type (XHR or Fetch)
- **URL**: Request URL
- **Status**: HTTP status code
- **Response**: Response body
- **Payload**: Request payload data
- **Timestamp**: Time of the request

## Code Breakdown

- **Failed Request Logging**: Intercepts XHR and Fetch calls, logging relevant details if a request fails.
- **CSV Conversion**: Converts log data into a CSV format, handling special characters for compatibility.
- **Download Mechanism**: Utilizes Blob and URL API to allow downloading the CSV file directly from the browser.
- **Debug Logging**: Verbose logging in the console for debugging, with messages prefixed by `[XHR/Fetch Logger Debug]`.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **No Logs**: If the download button shows "No failed requests logged yet," verify that the requests are indeed failing (status codes 400â€“599).
- **Blob or URL Errors**: These indicate browser support issues. Ensure your browser is updated.
